# Image Gallery

`Image Gallery` is a React application that allows users to search and view photos from Flickr. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching photos based on keywords and displaying them in a grid layout. Users can also view individual photos in a modal window for a closer look.

It utilizes React for building the user interface, allowing for efficient rendering and component-based architecture. The application incorporates infinite scrolling to display a large number of photos without overwhelming the user. Additionally, Tailwind CSS is used for responsive and customizable styling, enabling a modern and visually appealing design.
